## 👋 Hi there, I'm Junaid Aslam

🔧 I'm a **Senior Software Engineer** with **7 years of experience**, specializing in **.NET**.  
🌐 I also enjoy front-end development with **React (JS/TS)**. 
🤖 Recently, I’ve been exploring the world of **AI Agents & Chatbots**. I started with no-code/low-code tools like **Botpress**, **MindStudio**, and **Voiceflow**, and have since moved on to exploring more advanced tools/frameworks including **Langchain**, **OpenAI SDK**, and **HuggingFace**.
🏗️ I’m particularly interested in projects that involve **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**, **Microservices**, and **AI Integration Engineering**.

💡 **Fun Fact:** I genuinely love what I do, and I strive to do it better every day.
