## 👋 Hi there, I'm Junaid Aslam

🔧 I'm a **Software Engineer** with over **6 years of experience**, specializing in building robust solutions with **.NET**.  
🌐 I also enjoy crafting modern front-ends using **React (JS/TS)**.  
🤖 Recently, I’ve been exploring the world of **AI Agents & Chatbots** with low-code tools like **Botpress**, **MindStudio**, and **Voiceflow**.  
🏗️ I’m particularly interested in projects that involve **Microservices** and **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**.  
🌱 I'm always learning, iterating, and levelling up my skills.

💡 **Fun Fact:** I genuinely love what I do — and I strive to do it better every day.
